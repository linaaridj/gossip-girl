    SPOTTED: N, alone in the cold, just frozen out by one cold heart. We thought it was pretty obvious you shouldn't mix business with pleasure, N. Will Little J and N fix their issues, or is this an affair to remember? S and D sipping coffee at Saint Ambrose's, and V also happened to walk in, and then walk right back out. Yesss. Poor V. Haven't you heard the expression "the early bird gets the worm"? B and C are officially the couple of the month on our radar, but how long will the marriage really stand? After all, we spotted C with Little Miss Ivy Dickens in the back of his limo. Making a deal? Or just two old friends catching up? Hmm.. Georgina Sparks is officially back in town, and on her arm, is the one and only Jack Bass. We're all dying to know if C's run-in with Ivy Dickens is related to the delicious news of G and Uncle Jackass. Is there more to the story, or am I just being anxious? No matter what the deal is, I can be sure that this will be one hell of a summer.</p>
